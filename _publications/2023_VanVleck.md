**Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco** and Siân E. Dutton.

A method paper for a Python script I wrote for calculating the Van Vleck distortion modes, which can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/lnaglecocco/VanVleckCalculator). This project began as part of my analysis of supercells producted by "big box analysis" of pair distribution function data on NaNiO<sub>2</sub>. 

Accepted for publication at IUCr Journal of Applied Crystallography on 15th November 2023, currently available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18255) while in press.
