**Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco** and Siân E. Dutton.

A method paper for a Python script I wrote for calculating the Van Vleck distortion modes, which can be found on [https://github.com/lnaglecocco/VanVleckCalculator](my GitHub). This project began as part of my analysis of supercells producted by "big box analysis" of pair distribution function data on NaNiO<sub>2</sub>.
