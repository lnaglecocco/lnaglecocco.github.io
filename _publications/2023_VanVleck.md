**Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco** and Siân E. Dutton.

A method paper for a Python script I wrote for calculating the Van Vleck distortion modes, which can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/lnaglecocco/VanVleckCalculator). This project began as part of my analysis of supercells producted by "big box analysis" of pair distribution function data on NaNiO<sub>2</sub>. 

Published [online in the IUCr Journal of Applied Crystallography](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S1600576723009925) on 22nd December 2023.
