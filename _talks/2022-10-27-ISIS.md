During my 15 minute talk, I discussed [my variable-pressure neutron diffraction study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03345) in some detail, outlining the background and findings of this work. I also briefly introduced my ongoing variable-temperature Pair Distribution Function study on NaNiO<sub>2</sub>.

After my 15 minute talk, there was a 5 minute Q&A session.
