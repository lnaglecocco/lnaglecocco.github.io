The ISIS Student Meeting 2022 was a meeting of masters and PhD students, with a few undergraduates, united in their shared interest in neutron and muon scattering. It was hosted at the Visitor Centre of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory on 27th October 2022. I was one of the attendees selected to share the results of my research.

During my 15 minute talk, I discussed [my variable-pressure neutron diffraction study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03345) in some detail, outlining the background and findings of this work. I also briefly introduced my ongoing variable-temperature Pair Distribution Function study on NaNiO<sub>2</sub>.

After my 15 minute talk, there was a 5 minute Q&A session.
