The Winter Crystallography Meeting was hosted at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory visitor centre on the 6th February 2023, attended by students and professors mostly from the UK. I was one of the attendees selected to share some results of my research.

In this talk, I discussed my ongoing variable-temperature Pair Distribution Function study on NaNiO<sub>2</sub> using data obtained from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and presented preliminary analysis of my EXAFS data on the material.
