About me
------
I am a PhD student in physics at the University of Cambridge, working at the interface between materials physics and solid state chemistry. My PhD research focuses on the Jahn-Teller effect under varying temperature and pressure in bulk materials, particularly battery cathode materials.

Interests
------
- Solid state chemistry
- Electrochemistry
- Crystallography
- Magnetism
- Diffraction
- X-ray absorption spectroscopy
- Electron energy loss spectroscopy
