About me
------
I am a PhD student in physics at the University of Cambridge, working at the interface between materials physics and solid state chemistry. My PhD research focuses on the crystallographic, structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of Ni-rich battery cathode materials based on LiNiO<sub>2</sub> and NaNiO<sub>2</sub>. 

Interests
------
- Solid state chemistry
- Electrochemistry
- Crystallography
- Magnetism
- Diffraction
- X-ray absorption spectroscopy
- Electron energy loss spectroscopy
