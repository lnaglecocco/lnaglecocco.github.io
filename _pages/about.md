About me
------
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Strange Group](https://web.slac.stanford.edu/strangegroup) at the [Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, working on materials characterisation for water-splitting applications as part of the H2NEW consortium. I obtained my PhD in physics in the [Dutton Group](duttongroup.weebly.com) at the University of Cambridge, working at the interface between materials physics and solid state chemistry.

Interests
------
- Solid state chemistry
- Water splitting technology
- Electrochemistry
- Crystallography
- Magnetism
- Diffraction
- X-ray absorption spectroscopy
